# Reinforcement-Learning-in-Equity-Market-Making

This project constructed a simulation environment that allows multiple different market making agents and investor agents interact with each other. It also built a training skeleton for the RL agents, including Q-learning and Deep Q-Network.

The project's paper is attached.
