# Reinforcement-Learning-in-Equity-Market-Making

This project constructs a simulation environment that allows multiple different market making agents and investor agents interact with each other. It also built a training skeleton for the RL agents, including Q-learning and Deep Q-Network. To be closer to the real world, it calibrates the simulation parameters using actual tradebook and limit order book data.

The motivation is: market making can be easily framed into a RL problem and could be very interesting to look at. The objective is to validate that RL agent can outperform the other market making agents under most of the market circumstances.
