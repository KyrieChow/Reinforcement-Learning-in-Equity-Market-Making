# Reinforcement-Learning-in-Equity-Market-Making

This project constructs a simulation environment that allows multiple different market making agents and investor agents interact with each other. It also built a training skeleton for the RL agents, including Q-learning and Deep Q-Network.

The motivation is: market making can be easily framed into a RL problem and could be very interesting to look at. The objective is to validate that RL agent can outperform the other market making agents under most of the market circumstances.

The project is the Applied Financial Project of Master in Financial Engineering program of UC Berkeley. The original project paper is attached. And the project is further improved with cleaner code structure and better model skeleton.
